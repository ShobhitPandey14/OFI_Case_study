The Dynamic Fleet Manager is a Python-based logistics optimization dashboard that dynamically assigns the best vehicle to each order under real-world constraints such as availability, distance, fuel cost, emissions, and special handling requirements.

Built with Streamlit, pandas, and Plotly, the application provides a modern, interactive, and data-driven interface to visualize, analyze, and manage fleet assignments efficiently.
